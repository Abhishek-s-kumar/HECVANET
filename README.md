Secure communication in Vehicle Networks using asymmetric key exchange over an insecure channel using 
ECC, HECC genus 2 and HECC genus 3 and symmetric encryption - decryption using AES with the common secret
that was exchanged as key.

Tools:

NS-3 version 3.30, libg2hec, micro-ecc.
Implemented g3hec based on libg2hec and integrated them to NS-3.

libg2hec and g3hec require Math and NTL libraries for arithmetic operations of Groups and Finite Fields.
